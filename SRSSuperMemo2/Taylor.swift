 Taylor Swift - Blank Space
 
 Nice to meet you, where you been?
 I could show you incredible things
 Magic, madness, heaven, sin
 Saw you there and I thought
 Oh my God, look at that face
 You look like my next mistake
 Love's a game, want to play?
 New money, suit and tie
 I can read you like a magazine
 Ain't it funny, rumors fly
 And I know you heard about me
 So hey, let's be friends
 I'm dying to see how this one ends
 Grab your passport and my hand
 I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

 So it's gonna be forever
 Or it's gonna go down in flames
 You can tell me when it's over
 If the high was worth the pain
 Got a long list of ex-lovers
 They'll tell you I'm insane
 'Cause you know I love the players
 And you love the game2

 'Cause we're young and we're reckless
 We'll take this way too far
 It'll leave you breathless
 Or with a nasty scar
 Got a long list of ex-lovers
 They'll tell you I'm insane
 But I've got a blank space baby
 And I'll write your name
